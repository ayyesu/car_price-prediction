This project aims to predict car prices based on a dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset contains information about various car attributes, including make, model, year, mileage, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle:

- Dataset URL: [Car Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/CooperUnion/cardataset)

Please download the dataset and place it in the `/data` directory before running the code. The code also uses the dataset url directly from my github repo

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the price of cars based on their features. The steps involved in this project include:

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, exploring, and preparing the dataset for modeling.
2. Feature Engineering: Selecting and creating relevant features for the prediction task.
3. Model Selection: Choosing an appropriate machine learning algorithm for regression.
4. Model Training: Training the selected model on the dataset.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
6. Prediction: Using the trained model to make price predictions for new data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
